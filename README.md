## Introduction
This is a task manager tool created using React.js, Bootstrap 4, and reactstrap.

## Current Functionality
Create, Read, Update, and Delete Tasks and Sub-Tasks. For now, everything is stored in local storage. This means data persists unless local storage is cleared, or user switches to a different browser.

There is also a task filter with options to filter by due date, name, and priority.

General styling is done using Bootstrap, and reactstrap is used for the collapse components.
